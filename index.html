    <h1>Instructor/Technical Trainer</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Craig.</p>
    <p>
      As a software development trainer, I've channeled my lifelong love of
      learning into a career. I appreciate the opportunity to constantly meet
      intelligent, motivated people trying to learn new technology and help them
      understand how it can be applied to the problems in their organization.

      Thanks for stopping by and checking out my site. I’m Craig McKeachie. I’ve
      been a software developer for nearly 20 years at this point mostly on the
      Microsoft stack. I’ve been a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer
      (MCSD) for three generations of technology including VB6 and COM+ and two
      generations of .NET certifications. In the past, I was a Microsoft
      Certified Trainer and have always had an interest in teaching most likely
      because many of my family members taught including my mother, several of
      my uncles, and my grandfather (in a one room schoolhouse). About 8 years
      ago, I became more interested in front-end development (HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript), usability and user experience after working as a consultant
      at a few different digital interactive agencies on projects. For the past
      4 years, I’ve been immersing myself in the innovation happening in
      JavaScript development and transitioning into a career as a technical
      trainer/ instructor specializing in JavaScript and in particular the
      application framework
      <a href="http://angular.io">Angular</a>. I live outside Columbus, Ohio
      with my wonderful wife and two really fun boys ages 9 and 13.
